# Acrostic
A Go (golang) library that returns an acrostical phrase for a given word.

Initially, the library will return a series of adjectives followed by a
single noun for the given acrostic.  However, the intention is to extend
this library to flexibly return adjectives and/or nouns at the consumer's
discretion.

Consider this library alpha quality.  There is more work to do and not
much of my time to do it.  With that said, all pull requests are welcome.
